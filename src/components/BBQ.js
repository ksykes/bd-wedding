                <p>Please help us celebrate Brandie & Dylan! This is a family event so children are welcome. Hamburgers and light desserts will be served. If the weather permits, the pool will be open for a swim so donâ€™t forget your towel and bathing suit!</p>
                <p>We know it isn't traditional, it's not the way it's done. But instead of a toaster, they'd like a little fun! So if you'd like to give a gift, to help them celebrate... some help towards their honeymoon, that they would appreciate!</p>
                <p>If you have any questions, please contact Carleigh at <a href="mailto:Carleigh.Roughley@gmail.com">Carleigh.Roughley@gmail.com</a> or (416) 606-6915.</p>
